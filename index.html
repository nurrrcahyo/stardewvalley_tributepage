		<h2 id="about">About Eric Barone</h2>
		<p>The man, a single man, behind one of the best game ever created, the Stardew Valley. Out of his struggle to land a job, he creates a video game.
		By creates, I mean doing the code, illustrating the visual in pixel style, writing the plot, developing the characters, composing the music, all by himself
		for over 4 years. <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/">The website says</a> that the game has been aready sold over 41 million copies across all platform.</p>

		<h2>Works</h2>
		<p>There is not much that the internet knows about his works but two. One of them is <em>that gem</em>, Stardew Valley, and the other is the upcoming Haunted Chocolatier.</p>
		<h3>Stardew Valley</h3>
		<p>Released on 2016, the game is about creating nostalgia of him playing the game most of us milleniasls love, <i>the Harvest Moon</i>.
		But it's not just about sowing seeds and feeding the cattles. It's more than that. If Harvest Moon is about farming life and social interaction, it adds two more aspect; combat and crafting.</p>
		
		<h3>Haunted Chocolatier</h3>
		<p>So little known about this particular title. However, as the teaser video Ape posted on 2021, the artstyle is the same as its sibling title.
		And what I can understand is that the premise revolves around a man who runs a chocolate factory that the indregients he needs must be collected by fighting monsters. Well, let him cook.</p>

		<h2>Why He Inspired Me</h2>
		<p>One man army who struggled to find a job and chose to do what he loves instead and ends up getting wealthy. How can it not inspire a man like me? The dedication to work 10 hours a day, 7 days a week for over 4 years, it's magical.
		I hope I can  at least imitate his work ethics.</p>
